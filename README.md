## Design for Business Review Slides Using Flask

### HTML Files

**1. index.html:**
- This will be the main HTML file for the business review slides presentation.
- It will include the necessary HTML structure for displaying slides, controls for navigation, and content for each slide.

**2. slide.html:**
- This HTML file will serve as a template for individual slides in the presentation.
- It will include content-specific HTML for each slide, ensuring consistency in design and layout.

**3. custom.css:**
- This CSS file will contain custom styles specifically tailored for the presentation.
- It will define fonts, colors, and other visual elements to create a cohesive and professional look.

### Routes

**1. Home Route (`/`):**
- This route will handle the initial request and serve the main HTML file (index.html).
- It will be the entry point for the presentation, showcasing the first slide.

**2. Next Slide Route (`/next`):**
- This route will handle the navigation to the next slide in the presentation when the 'Next' button is clicked.
- It will update the content area of the main HTML file with the HTML for the next slide.

**3. Previous Slide Route (`/previous`):**
- This route will handle the navigation to the previous slide in the presentation when the 'Previous' button is clicked.
- Similar to the next slide route, it will update the content area with the HTML for the previous slide.

**4. Slide Select Route (`/select/:slide_number`):**
- This route will allow users to jump to a specific slide by providing a slide number in the URL.
- It will load the HTML for the specified slide and display it in the main HTML file.

**5. Present Slide Route (`/present`):**
- This route will handle the presentation mode of the slides, providing a fullscreen and distraction-free environment.
- It will typically be triggered by a 'Present' button and will modify the CSS to optimize the presentation mode.
